Starting from today 4/12/23, I'll try my best to solve atleast one CP [ competitive programming ] problem for the next 100 days. Hopefully I manage to complete my task everyday.

So I started at rating 0 at the beginning of this challenge. Today after 56 days of daily problems [almost 200+ problems] and 5 Contests[mostly division 2 and division 3], I have crossed the rating 1000. I'm very glad I did this daily. Now, I realised that just doing problems without a proper order didn't really let me learn a lot. So from today, I wanna follow an order. To do this, I am using the Competitive Programmer's Handbook by CSES; available over [https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf]. I'll read each topic and then solve 100 to 150 problems on that topic. My plan is 200 problems for important topic ie 50 Easy - 100 Medium - 50 Hard && 100 problems for other topics ie 25 Easy - 50 Medium - 25 Hard. I'll stay with my current 4 problems a day streak.

Topic 1 :
  Sorting : Easy [4 done] - Medium - Hard
